## Scope
- Review Kotlin code under `src/main/kotlin` and Gradle config.
- Enforce Kotlin 1.9.24 idioms, null-safety, data classes, sealed hierarchies.
- Spring Boot 3.2 conventions (constructor injection, configuration properties).
- Hexagonal architecture: ports/adapters boundaries, service purity.

## Tasks
1) Run `!./gradlew clean build` and summarize errors.
2) Point out anti-patterns (field injection, nullable abuse, blocking IO in controllers).
3) Propose diffs with fixes, justify trade-offs briefly.
