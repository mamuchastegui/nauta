## Scope
- Review queries and schema. Focus on indexes, execution plans, and connection pool settings.
- Prefer prepared statements, avoid N+1.

## Tasks
1) For each critical query, provide a hypothetical `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` discussion and expected plan.
2) Recommend indexes (btree/hash/gin/gist) with rationale and write DDL suggestions.
3) Suggest pool sizing and timeouts for Spring Data / HikariCP.
